This project is a simple Flappy Bird game implemented on an LCD and controlled via a joystick, designed for the NUCLEO L476RG board with MBED Studio 1.4.1 or later. The game features a bird sprite that moves up and down, avoiding obstacles in the form of tubes. The hardware requirements include the NUCLEO L476RG board, an N5110 LCD, a joystick with X and Y axes, additional buttons, and appropriate wiring. To set up, follow the circuit schematic provided in the project repository, import the Joystick and N5110 libraries, compile the code, and flash it onto the NUCLEO board. Once the hardware is connected and the code is flashed, pressing the free button starts the game. The joystick controls the bird's movement—up, down, left, or right—to navigate through the tubes and score points. If the bird collides with a tube, the game ends. To exit the game, press the joystick button.
